# Instant-Insanity

An attempt to implement Instant Insanity in python

First we will try to implement it using an OOP approach

We will then random generate stacks of n cubes with m colors and attempt to to find combinations with no solutions, half solutions, and full solutions, all of which will be stored in text csv files to be used for data analysis and perhaps machine learning will also be utilized to find patterns that may be difficult to see.
